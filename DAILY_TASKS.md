# Consonance's 100 Days of Code Daily Tasks

### *Day 1: Guess My Number!!!* 

The computer randomly generates a number. The user inputs a number, and the computer will tell you if you are too high, or too low. Then you will get to keep guessing until you guess the number.


### *Day 2: Factorial Finder*

The Factorial of a positive integer, n, is defined as the product of the sequence n, n-1, n-2, ...1 and the factorial of zero, 0, is defined as being 1. You are to write a program that finds the factorial of a number. Solve this  using both loops and recursion.

### *Day 3: Get to know about Git and GitHub.*
Create an account on Github if you don’t have one.
Fork the 100 days of code repo, add an aboutme.md file as written in the README.md and make a PR...
Kindly add Day 1 and Day 2 submissions if you have completed it.

If you have any issues in this task , kindly relay them in the #100daysofcodehelp channel on slack for support


### *Day 4: Check if Palindrome*

Check if the string entered by a user is a palindrome. That is that it reads the same forwards as backwards like “racecar” or yesterday => "7102017".

### *Day 5: Count Vowels*

Enter a string and the program counts the number of vowels in the text. For added complexity have it report a sum of each vowel found in a long text.

### *Day 6: Count Letters in a Speech*

Attached is a text file containing the farewell speech of Barack Obama. The function should read content from the file, count and record all letters of the alphabet present. Output should be like => a: 20, b: 10, ...z: 5. It should also be case insensitive i.e 'a' == 'A'.

### *Day 7: Ordered words*

An ordered word is a word in which the letters appear in
alphabetic order. Take the user input, and order the letters in the word or
sentence alphabetically.

### *Day 8: Alarm Clock*

Alarm Clock - Build a simple clock where it plays a sound after X number of minutes/seconds or at a particular time set.

### *Day 9: Alarm Clock Extended*

Alarm Clock Extended - complete the alarm clock challenge if you haven't .......If you have, try and assist at least two people on the slack team to do so

### *Day 10: Calculator*

Calculator - A simple calculator to do basic operators(addition, subtraction, division, multiplication). Make it a scientific calculator(sin, cos, etc) for added complexity.
